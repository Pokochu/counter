### TODO:
Implement a simple backend application that satisfies the specifications below.
No need to build any frontend, only backend API.

### Specifications:

Your application should be implemented as a web service designed to be used by multiple clients. It should expose a few
endpoints to allow the following operations:

- Increment a `Counter` by 1;
- Get the current value of a given `Counter`;
- Get a list of all `Counters` and their current values;
- Create a new `Counter`;

### Notes:
- This API should be considered using by any client (WEB|Android|iOS)
- No need to hold a state between app's launches
- You can use any version of Java 11+.

Please, put your code into private git repo and give an access to the following persons:
- Fredrik Palmcrantz <fredrik.palmcrantz@qbtech.com>
- Agostinho Neto <agostinho.neto@qbtech.com>
- Vasily Samsonov <vasily.samsonov@qbtech.com>

Bonus points: if you can deploy your application in Heroku|AWS (we can play a bit)
